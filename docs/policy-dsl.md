# Policy DSL reference

A Halberd policy bundle is a YAML document describing which JSON-RPC tool
calls an MCP server is allowed to receive, and which arguments are
acceptable for each. Bundles are loaded once at proxy startup and compiled
to an in-memory matcher — regex patterns are precompiled, allowlists are
hashed.

## Top-level shape

```yaml
version: 1
server: <string>
tools: [<tool>...]
defaults:
  unknown_tool:   allow | deny | log_and_pass
  unknown_method: allow | deny | log_and_pass
response_filters:               # optional; absent = no response inspection
  global:
    strip_ansi_escapes: <bool>
    strip_zero_width:   <bool>
    secret_scanners:    [<scanner-name>...]
```

| Key | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | Must be `1`. Future-incompatible changes bump this. |
| `server` | yes | Free-form identifier; appears in audit-log entries. |
| `tools` | yes | List of tool rules. Empty list is valid but then every `tools/call` is rejected when `defaults.unknown_tool = deny`. |
| `defaults.unknown_tool` | no | Default: `deny`. |
| `defaults.unknown_method` | no | Default: `log_and_pass`. |

## Tool rule

```yaml
- name: <string>
  arguments:
    <arg-name>: <argument-rule>
```

Tools whose `name` is referenced by a `tools/call` request are matched
case-sensitively. A tool listed here with no `arguments` map is allowed
unconditionally — useful for read-only metadata calls like `list_tables`.

## Argument rule

```yaml
type:          string | number | boolean
max_length:    <int>          # only for type=string; bytes, not chars
allow_values:  [<string>...]  # strict enum; if non-empty, value must match
deny_patterns: [<regex>...]   # any match blocks the request
```

All four fields are optional. They combine with AND semantics: an argument
must pass type, length, allow_values, *and* every deny_pattern.

### Regex flavor

Patterns use Go's `regexp` package, which is RE2. **No backreferences, no
lookaround.** Use `(?i)` for case-insensitive matching. Patterns are
compiled at bundle load — invalid regex fails `halberd lint` with the file
and line number.

### Length limits

`max_length` is measured in bytes of the UTF-8 encoded string, not Unicode
code points. The default upper bound for any string argument should be
8192 — long-tail tools rarely need more, and capping protects against
denial-of-service via oversized payloads.

## Response inspection

`response_filters.global` configures sanitization applied to JSON-RPC
responses flowing from the upstream MCP server back to the agent. The
inspector parses the response envelope, walks the `result` subtree, and
sanitizes every string leaf. The envelope's `jsonrpc`, `id`, and `error`
fields round-trip verbatim — Halberd does not touch protocol metadata.

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `strip_ansi_escapes` | Removes CSI (`\x1b[...]`) and OSC (`\x1b]...\x07`) escape sequences. Tool output has no legitimate reason to contain terminal-control codes; their presence is a strong tool-poisoning signal. |
| `strip_zero_width` | Removes U+200B/U+200C/U+200D/U+2060/U+FEFF. These are invisible but can carry steganographic payloads or split injection markers across log scrapers. |
| `secret_scanners` | List of built-in detectors that replace matches with `[REDACTED]`. |

Built-in scanner names:

- `aws_access_key` — `AKIA…` (standard) and `ASIA…` (STS) keys
- `github_token` — `ghp_…` / `ghs_…` / `gho_…` / `ghr_…` / `ghu_…`, 36+ chars
- `rsa_private_key` — `-----BEGIN [RSA|OPENSSH|EC|DSA] PRIVATE KEY-----` blocks, redacted from BEGIN to END

A bundle with no `response_filters` block does no response-side work
whatsoever — every response forwards verbatim. The check happens once at
proxy startup, not per-request.

### What response inspection does *not* cover in v0.1

- **SSE streams.** When the upstream sends `Content-Type:
  text/event-stream`, Halberd forwards events unchanged. Per-event
  inspection is on the v0.2 roadmap.
- **The `error` field.** Server-defined error messages are not
  sanitized — operators inspect them directly in audit logs.
- **Per-tool response policy.** Only `response_filters.global` exists in
  v0.1. Per-tool constraints (`max_rows`, response-shape validation) land
  in v0.2.

## What Halberd does *not* validate

By design, the v0.1 DSL is deliberately small. It does **not** support:

- Nested object/array argument schemas
- Cross-argument constraints (`if a == "X" then b is required`)
- Custom Go callbacks or scripting
- Inheritance / `include:` between bundles

If you need those, you're probably looking for [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
or [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/). Halberd's design point is
fast-path matching on the 90% of MCP tool surfaces that take a flat
`{string, number, boolean}` argument map.
