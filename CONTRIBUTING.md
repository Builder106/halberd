# Contributing to Halberd

Thanks for the interest. Halberd is small and opinionated; this document
exists so we don't waste each other's time on PRs that won't land.

## Dev setup

```bash
brew install go         # or your platform's equivalent
git clone https://github.com/Builder106/halberd
cd halberd
go mod tidy
go test ./...
```

To run the proxy against a local MCP server:

```bash
go build -o bin/halberd-http ./cmd/halberd-http
./bin/halberd-http --policy policies/mcp-server-postgres.yaml \
                   --target  http://localhost:8080 \
                   --listen  :9090
```

## Project-specific guardrails

- **Latency is a feature.** The policy engine sits on every JSON-RPC request.
  p50 added latency must stay below 200 µs and p99 below 1 ms on the bench
  corpus. PRs that regress `BenchmarkEngine_*` are reverted.
- **No third-party dependencies without a strong reason.** Halberd currently
  depends on the Go standard library and `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`. Adding a
  dependency requires a paragraph in the PR description explaining why a
  stdlib equivalent does not work.
- **Rule packs are data, not code.** New protections for a specific MCP
  server go in `policies/<server-name>.yaml`, not in `internal/policy/`.
- **The engine is IO-free.** `internal/policy` does not import `os`, `net`,
  or `io`. Anything that talks to the outside world goes in `cmd/` or
  `internal/transport/` or `internal/audit/`.

## Commit and PR conventions

- Imperative-mood subject line ≤ 72 chars.
- Body explains *why*. The diff already explains *what*.
- One logical change per PR. If a refactor and a feature land together, split
  them — refactor first.
- All tests pass and `go vet ./...` is clean before opening the PR.

## Out of scope (please don't open these PRs)

- **WebSocket transport.** Deprecated in the 2025-06 MCP spec; Halberd only
  supports stdio and streamable HTTP+SSE.
- **TLS termination / mTLS.** Offload to a reverse proxy in front of Halberd
  (nginx, Caddy, Envoy).
- **A web UI / dashboard.** The audit log is JSONL on disk; pipe it into
  whatever you already use.
- **Real-time LLM-based response classification.** Latency budget kills it.
  Future v0.2 may add an async out-of-band classifier; in-band is not on the
  table.
- **Distributed clustering / replication.** Halberd is a single-process
  proxy. Run one per upstream MCP server.

## Reporting security issues
